<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Frankism</strong>&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Sabbatean" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatean">Sabbatean</a>&nbsp;Jewish religious movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,&nbsp;centered on the leadership of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish Messiah claimant" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimant">Jewish Messiah claimant</a>&nbsp;<a title="Jacob Frank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank">Jacob Frank</a>, who lived from 1726 to 1791. Frank rejected religious norms, and said his followers were obligated to transgress as many moral boundaries as possible. At its height it claimed perhaps 500,000 followers, primarily&nbsp;<a title="Jews" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Jews</a>&nbsp;living in&nbsp;<a title="Poland" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland">Poland</a>&nbsp;and other parts of&nbsp;<a title="Eastern Europe" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="Description" class="mw-headline">Description</span></h2>
<p>Unlike traditional&nbsp;<a title="Judaism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism">Judaism</a>, which provides a set of detailed guidelines called "<a title="Halakha" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha">halakha</a>" that are scrupulously followed by observant Jews and regulate many aspects of life,&nbsp;Frank claimed that "all laws and teachings will fall" and &ndash; following&nbsp;<a title="Antinomianism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomianism">antinomianism</a>&nbsp;&ndash; asserted that the most important obligation of every person was the transgression of every boundary.</p>
<p>Frankism is associated with the&nbsp;<a title="Sabbateans" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbateans">Sabbateans</a>&nbsp;of Turkey, a religious movement that identified the 17th-century Jewish rabbi&nbsp;<a title="Sabbatai Zevi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi">Sabbatai Zevi</a>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<a title="Messiah in Judaism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_in_Judaism">Messiah</a>.&nbsp;Like Frankism, the earlier forms of Sabbateanism believed that at least in some circumstances,&nbsp;<a title="Antinomianism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinomianism">antinomianism</a>&nbsp;was the correct path.&nbsp;Zevi himself would perform actions that violated traditional Jewish taboos, such as eating foods that were forbidden by&nbsp;<a title="Kashrut" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut">kashrut</a>&nbsp;(Jewish dietary laws) and celebrating prescribed fast days as feast days.&nbsp;Especially after Zevi's death, a number of branches of Sabbateanism evolved, which disagreed among themselves over which aspects of traditional Judaism should be preserved and which discarded.&nbsp;The more radical branches even engaged in sexual foreplay. In Frankism,&nbsp;<a title="Orgy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgy">orgies</a>&nbsp;featured prominently in ritual.</p>
<p>Several authorities on Sabbateanism, including&nbsp;<a title="Heinrich Graetz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Graetz">Heinrich Graetz</a>&nbsp;and Aleksander Kraushar, were skeptical of the existence of such a thing as a distinctive "Frankist" doctrine. According to&nbsp;<a title="Gershom Scholem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_Scholem">Gershom Scholem</a>, another authority on Sabbateanism, Kraushar had described Frank's sayings as "grotesque, comical and incomprehensible". In his classic essay "Redemption Through Sin", Scholem argued a different position, seeing Frankism as a later and more radical outgrowth of Sabbateanism.&nbsp;In contrast,&nbsp;<a title="Jay Michaelson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Michaelson">Jay Michaelson</a>&nbsp;argues that Frankism was "an original theology that was innovative, if sinister" and was in many respects a departure from the earlier formulations of Sabbateanism. In traditional Sabbatean doctrine, Zevi &ndash; and often his followers &ndash; claimed to be able to liberate the sparks of holiness hidden within what seemed to be evil. According to Michaelson, Frank's theology asserted that the attempt to liberate the sparks of holiness was the problem, not the solution. Rather, Frank claimed that the "mixing" between holy and unholy was virtuous.&nbsp;<a class="new" title="Netanel Lederberg (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Netanel_Lederberg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Netanel Lederberg</a>&nbsp;claims that Frank had a&nbsp;<a title="Gnosticism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">Gnostic</a>&nbsp;philosophy wherein there was a "true God" whose existence was hidden by a "false God". This "true God" could allegedly only be revealed through a total destruction of the social and religious structures created by the "false God", thus leading to a thorough antinomianism. For Frank, the very distinction between good and evil is a product of a world governed by the "false God". Lederberg compares Frank's position to that of&nbsp;<a title="Friedrich Nietzsche" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="After_Jacob_Frank" class="mw-headline">After Jacob Frank</span></h2>
<p>After Jacob Frank's death in 1791, his daughter&nbsp;<a title="Eve Frank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Frank">Eve</a>, who had been declared in 1770 to be the incarnation of the&nbsp;<a title="Shekhinah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekhinah">Shekhinah</a>, the dwelling of the&nbsp;<a title="Divine presence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_presence">divine presence</a>, continued to lead the movement with her brothers.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Sabbateans</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>Sabbatians</strong>) were a variety of followers of disciples and believers in&nbsp;<a title="Sabbatai Zevi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi">Sabbatai Zevi</a>&nbsp;(1626&ndash;1676), a&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Jew" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">Jewish</a>&nbsp;<a title="Rabbi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi">rabbi</a>&nbsp;who was proclaimed to be the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Jewish Messiah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah">Jewish Messiah</a>&nbsp;in 1666 by&nbsp;<a title="Nathan of Gaza" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_of_Gaza">Nathan of Gaza</a>. Vast numbers of Jews in the&nbsp;<a title="Jewish diaspora" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora">Jewish diaspora</a>&nbsp;accepted his claims, even after he became a&nbsp;<a title="Apostasy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy#Judaism">Jewish apostate</a>&nbsp;with his&nbsp;<a title="Sabbatai Zevi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi#Sabbatai_adopts_Islam">conversion to Islam</a>&nbsp;in the same year. Sabbatai Zevi's followers, both during his "Messiahship" and after his conversion to Islam, are known as Sabbateans.

<p>In&nbsp;<a title="Jewish history" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_history">Jewish history</a>&nbsp;many Jews after Sabbatai Zvi's apostasy, although horrified, clung to the belief that Zvi could still be regarded as the true Jewish messiah.&nbsp;They constituted the largest number of Sabbateans during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the nineteenth century Jewish Sabbateans had been reduced to small groups of hidden followers who feared being discovered for their beliefs that were deemed to be entirely heretical and antithetical to classical Judaism. These very Jews fell under the category of Sectarian Sabbateans which was born when many Sabbateans refused to accept that Zvi's apostasy might have been indicative of the fact that their faith was genuinely an illusion.</p>
<p>Another large group of Sabbateans succeeding the apostasy began to view Islam in an extremely negative light.&nbsp;Polemics against Islam erupted directly after Zvi's conversion. Some of these attacks were considered part of a largely Anti-Sabbatean agenda.&nbsp;Accusations coming from Anti-Sabbateans revolved around the idea that Sabbatai Zvi's conversion to Islam was rightfully an indicator of a false claim of messianism.</p>

<p>Jewish historians&nbsp;have stated that it is hard to describe the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife&nbsp;<a title="Sabbatai Zevi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi#Marriage_to_Sarah">Sarah</a>&nbsp;and most of his closest relatives and friends.&nbsp;<a title="Nathan of Gaza" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_of_Gaza">Nathan of Gaza</a>, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.</p>
<h2><span id="Sabbatean_.E2.80.93_Sufi_similarities"></span><span id="Sabbatean_&ndash;_Sufi_similarities" class="mw-headline">Sabbatean &ndash; Sufi similarities</span></h2>
<p>Claims of ties between Sabbatean Kabbalah and&nbsp;<a title="Sufism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism">Sufism</a>&nbsp;go back to the days of Sabbatai Zevi.[2]&nbsp;This is largely based on the contention that Zevi's exile in the Balkans brought him into close contact with several forms of unorthodox Sufism which existed in the region. The D&ouml;nme community of Salonika came to play a significant role in the Sufi life of the region and its members actively involved with a number of Sufi orders, particularly the Mevlevi. Some alleged similarities between D&ouml;nme and unorthodox Sufi practice seem&nbsp;to exist, including the violation of&nbsp;<em>kashrut/halal</em>, sexual license, ecstatic singing, mystical interpretations of sacred scripture, and the practice of ritual meals. However, confirmed direct ties between Sabbatai Zevi and any Sufi order are conjectural and hearsay. The often claimed connection between the movement and&nbsp;<a title="Bektashi Order" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bektashi_Order">Bektashi Sufism</a>&nbsp;relies merely on circumstantial evidence and coincidence rather than any concrete substantiation. During Zevi's lifetime the Bektashi order had yet to attain widespread popularity in the Balkans; it came to dominate southern Albania only in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, there were a number of other heterodox Sufi movements in the region in the mid-17th century, including the Hamzevis, Melamis and Qalandars.</p>

<h3><span id="The_Emden-Eybeschutz_controversy" class="mw-headline">The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy</span></h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="Jacob Emden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden#The_Emden-Eybesch.C3.BCtz_Controversy">Emden-Eybeschutz controversy</a>&nbsp;was a serious rabbinical disputation with wider political ramifications in Europe that followed the accusations by Rabbi&nbsp;<a title="Jacob Emden" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden">Jacob Emden</a>&nbsp;(1697&ndash;1776) who was a fierce opponent of the Sabbateans, against Rabbi&nbsp;<a title="Jonathan Eybeschutz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Eybeschutz">Jonathan Eybeschutz</a>&nbsp;(1690&ndash;1764) whom he accused of being a secret Sabbatean.</p>
<p>The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy arose concerning the&nbsp;<a title="Amulet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet">amulets</a>&nbsp;which Emden suspected Eybeschutz of issuing. It was alleged that these amulets recognized the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi.&nbsp;Emden then accused Eybeschutz of heresy. Emden was known for his attacks directed against the adherents, or those he supposed to be adherents, of Sabbatai Zevi. In Emden's eyes, Eybeschutz was a convicted Sabbatean.&nbsp;The controversy lasted several years, continuing even after Eybeschutz's death.</p>
<p>Emden's assertion of&nbsp;<a title="Heresy" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy#Heresy_in_Judaism">heresy</a>&nbsp;was chiefly based on the interpretation of some&nbsp;<a title="Amulet" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amulet">amulets</a>&nbsp;prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden professed to see Sabbatean allusions. Hostilities began before Eybeschutz left&nbsp;<a title="Prague" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a>; when Eybeschutz was named chief rabbi of the three communities of Altona,&nbsp;<a title="Hamburg" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Wandsbek" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandsbek">Wandsbek</a>&nbsp;(1751), the controversy reached the stage of intense and bitter antagonism. Emden maintained that he was at first prevented by threats from publishing anything against Eybeschutz. He solemnly declared in his synagogue the writer of the amulets to be a Sabbathean heretic and deserving of&nbsp;<em><a title="Herem (censure)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herem_(censure)">cherem</a></em>&nbsp;(<a title="Excommunication" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunication">excommunication</a>).</p>
<p>The majority of the rabbis in Poland, Moravia, and Bohemia, as well as the leaders of the Three Communities, supported Eybeschutz:&nbsp;the accusation was "utterly incredible" - in 1725, Eybeschutz was among the&nbsp;<a title="Prague" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a>&nbsp;rabbis who excommunicated the Sabbatean sect.&nbsp;(Others&nbsp;suggest that the rabbis issued this ruling because they feared the repercussions if their leading figure was found to be a Sabbatean).</p>
<p>The controversy was a momentous incident in&nbsp;<a title="Jewish history" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_history">Jewish history</a>&nbsp;of the period, involving both Rabbi&nbsp;<a title="Yechezkel Landau" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechezkel_Landau">Yechezkel Landau</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="Vilna Gaon" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. In 1760 the quarrel broke out once more when some Sabbatean elements were discovered among the students of Eybeschutz'&nbsp;<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Yeshivah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivah">yeshivah</a></em>. At the same time his younger son, Wolf, presented himself as a Sabbatean prophet, with the result that the&nbsp;<em>yeshivah</em>&nbsp;was closed.</p>
<h3><span id="Sabbateans_and_early_Hasidism" class="mw-headline">Sabbateans and early Hasidism</span></h3>
<p>Some scholars see seeds of the Hasidic movement within the Sabbatean movement.&nbsp;When Hasidism began to spread its influence, a serious schism evolved between the&nbsp;<a title="Hasidic Judaism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism">Hasidic</a>&nbsp;and non-Hasidic Jews. Those who rejected the Hasidic movement dubbed themselves as&nbsp;<em><a title="Misnagdim" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnagdim">misnagdim</a></em>&nbsp;("opponents").</p>
<p>Critics of Hasidic Judaism&nbsp;expressed concern that Hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both&nbsp;<a title="Sabbatai Zevi" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi">Sabbatai Zevi</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Jacob Frank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Frank">Jacob Frank</a>. However the&nbsp;<a title="Baal Shem Tov" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Shem_Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a>, the founder of Hasidism, came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two Jewish&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="False messiah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_messiah">false messiahs</a>&nbsp;Sabbatai Zevi (1626&ndash;1676) and Jacob Frank (1726&ndash;1791) in particular.</p>
<h3><span id="Sabbateans_and_modern_secularism" class="mw-headline">Sabbateans and modern secularism</span></h3>
<p>Some scholars have noted that the Sabbatean movement in general fostered and connected well with the principles of modern&nbsp;<a title="Secularism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism">secularism</a>.&nbsp;Related to this is the drive of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Donmeh" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donmeh">Donmeh</a>&nbsp;in Turkey for secularizing their society just as European Jews promoted the values of&nbsp;<a title="Age of Enlightenment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>&nbsp;and its Jewish equivalent the&nbsp;<em><a title="Haskalah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah">haskalah</a></em>.</p>

<p>Sabbatai's conversion to Islam was extremely disheartening for the world's Jewish communities. Among the masses of the people the greatest confusion reigned. In addition to the misery and disappointment from within, Muslims and Christians jeered at and scorned the credulous and duped Jews.&nbsp;In spite of Sabbatai's apostasy, many of his adherents still tenaciously clung to him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme.&nbsp;This belief was further upheld and strengthened by the likes of Nathan of Gaza and&nbsp;<a title="Samuel Primo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Primo">Samuel Primo</a>, who were interested in maintaining the movement.</p>
